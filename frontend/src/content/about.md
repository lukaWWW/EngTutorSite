# About Sarah Johnson - Your English Tutor

## My Journey

Hello, I'm Sarah Johnson, a dedicated English language tutor with over 10 years of experience helping students from around the world master English. My journey into language teaching began when I was studying for my Bachelor's degree in English Literature at Oxford University. During my summer breaks, I volunteered teaching English to refugees, which ignited my passion for language education.

After graduating with honors, I pursued a Master's degree in Applied Linguistics from University College London, where I specialized in second language acquisition. My research focused on effective teaching methodologies for adult learners, which continues to inform my approach today.

## Professional Background

I hold a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certification and have completed additional specialized training in business English, academic writing, and exam preparation (IELTS, TOEFL, Cambridge exams). Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of teaching at prestigious language schools in London, Tokyo, and Berlin before establishing my independent tutoring practice in 2018.

My teaching experience spans various contexts:

- University preparation courses for international students
- Corporate language training for multinational companies
- One-on-one tutoring for professionals seeking to improve their communication skills
- Specialized coaching for academic writing and publication
- Conversation classes for intermediate and advanced learners

## My Teaching Philosophy

I believe that language learning should be both effective and enjoyable. My approach combines structured learning with authentic communication practice. Rather than focusing solely on grammar rules and vocabulary lists, I create personalized learning experiences that align with each student's interests, goals, and learning style.

I strive to create a supportive and encouraging environment where students feel comfortable making mistakesâ€”an essential part of the learning process. My lessons incorporate real-world materials, technology, and varied activities to keep students engaged and motivated.

## Beyond Teaching

When I'm not teaching, you'll find me exploring new cultures through travel, attending language exchange meetups, or curling up with a good book. I'm an avid hiker and try to get outdoors whenever possible. I also volunteer as a mentor for first-generation university students pursuing careers in education.

I'm passionate about lifelong learning and regularly attend professional development workshops and conferences to stay current with the latest research and teaching methodologies.

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to meet new students and help them achieve their language goals. Whether you're a beginner taking your first steps in English or an advanced speaker looking to perfect your skills, I look forward to being part of your language learning journey.
