    "question": "How do I know which type of lesson is right for me?",
    "answer": "The best type of lesson depends on your goals, learning style, and budget.

We recommend booking a free consultation where we can discuss your needs and recommend the most suitable option."

    "question": "What levels of English proficiency do you teach?",

    "question": "How long does it typically take to improve my English level?",
    "answer": "Progress varies depending on your starting level, learning goals, frequency of lessons, and how much you practice outside of class. Many students report noticeable improvement in specific areas (like conversation or writing) within 1-2 months of regular lessons. Advancing a full proficiency level (e.g., from B1 to B2) typically takes 3-6 months of consistent study."

    "question": "Do you offer lessons on weekends or evenings?",
