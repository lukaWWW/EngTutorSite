# About Me - Ksenia Zarubina

Hello! I'm Ksenia Zarubina, and I'm passionate about helping students unlock their potential in the English language.

## My Journey with English

My own language learning journey has shaped my teaching approach. Born and raised in Russia, I dedicated myself to mastering English, achieving a score of 93 out of 100 on the Unified State Exam (UGE) in English – a testament to my early commitment.

My path took an exciting turn when I made the sudden decision to pursue higher education abroad. To make this dream a reality, I prepared for and successfully passed the TOEFL exam, achieving a B2 level. This opened the door for me to move to Austria, where I am currently studying entirely in English. Living and studying in an English-speaking academic environment has given me invaluable real-world experience and a deep understanding of the nuances of the language.

## My Teaching Experience & Approach

Alongside my studies, I've gained practical experience tutoring students, helping them navigate their own English learning challenges. I understand the hurdles learners face – from mastering grammar to building conversational confidence – because I've been there myself.

My approach is personalized and supportive. I believe in creating a comfortable learning environment where students feel empowered to practice and grow. I tailor my lessons to your specific goals, whether it's preparing for exams like the UGE or TOEFL, improving conversational skills, or building a strong foundation in English grammar and vocabulary.

Let's work together to achieve your English language goals!
